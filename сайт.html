        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Computers have transformed our world, but with great innovation comes great risk. 
            Among the digital dangers, computer viruses stand out as one of the most notorious threats. 
            These are malicious programs capable of copying themselves and spreading across systems, 
            disrupting operations, stealing data, or even rendering devices unusable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The term "virus" is used because, much like biological viruses, these programs infect hosts (computers), 
            replicate, and spread to others, leaving a trail of damage in their wake. Understanding these threats and 
            their classifications is the first step toward securing your digital life.

        <h2>Types of Computer Viruses</h2>
        <p>
            Computer viruses come in various forms, each with unique behaviors and targets. Here are some of the most common types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>File Infectors:</strong> These viruses attach themselves to executable files (.exe, .com) and activate when the file is run. 
                Once active, they can overwrite or corrupt other files on the system.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Boot Sector Viruses:</strong> They target the master boot record (MBR) of hard drives or USB drives. 
                These viruses are particularly dangerous as they load before the operating system, making them difficult to detect.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Macro Viruses:</strong> Exploiting macro programming languages used in office applications like Word and Excel, 
                these viruses spread through documents and can execute harmful tasks without the userâ€™s knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Polymorphic Viruses:</strong> Masters of disguise, these viruses modify their code each time they spread, 
                making traditional antivirus detection challenging.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Trojan Horses:</strong> Named after the infamous Greek tale, these programs masquerade as legitimate software but hide harmful intent, 
                such as stealing personal information or installing other malware.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Prevention Tips</h2>
        <p>
            The best defense against computer viruses is vigilance and preparation. Here are practical steps to protect yourself:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Install and regularly update trusted antivirus software to detect and remove threats.</li>
            <li>Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</li>
            <li>Keep your operating system and applications up to date with the latest security patches.</li>
            <li>Enable a firewall to block unauthorized access to your system.</li>
            <li>Back up important data frequently to minimize loss in case of an attack.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Remember, while technology advances, so do threats. Staying informed and cautious can save you from a world of digital trouble.
